## Asteroid --> EVM

Testnet compiler for Asteroid AST to EVM ByteCode.

### Encoding/ABI

Solidity uses the left-most 4 bytes of the SHA3 hash of the function signature (including parameters).

Asteroid currently uses the left-most 4 bytes of the SHA3 hash of the function/variable name.

TODO: does this necessitate some kind of ABI

## Access Modifiers

Solidity uses four function access modifiers, which have the following meanings.

| Name | Restriction |
|:-----------:|:----|
| external | Can only be called from outside the contract |
| internal | Can only be called by this contract and derived contracts |
| public   | Can be called from anywhere |
| private  | Can only be called by this contract |

In Asteroid, the ```public``` and ```private``` keywords derive their regular OOP meanings, and so function restrictions must be defined at a.BVM.level using different keywords.

| Name | Restriction |
|:-----------:|:----|
| external | Can only be called from outside the contract |
| internal | Can only be called from inside this contract |
| global   | Can be called from anywhere |

Note that this means that contracts can be both ```internal``` and ```private``` or ```public```.

Further, there is no default access level for functions. It must be specified by the writer of the contract. This is a deliberate design choice to encourage secure and gas-efficient practices (as reading calldata is cheaper than reading machineMemory) and therefore ```external``` functions are generally preferable to ```global``` functions where available.

## Asteroid Functions and Variables

These builtins are passed to the Asteroid compiler along with the traverser and prevent the compilation of.

These builtins are largely the same as Solidity, to promote consistency.

Block/Transaction Properties:

| Spec | Type | EVM OC | Description |
|:-----------:|:----:|:----------:|:----|
| msg.data | string | CALLDATA | complete calldata |
| msg.gas | uint | GAS | remaining gas |
| msg.sender | address | CALLER | sender of the message (current call) |
| msg.sig | bytes4 | N/A | First 4 bytes of msg.data |
| block.timestamp | uint | TIMESTAMP | current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch |
| block.number | uint | BLOCKNUMBER | current block number |
| block.blockhash(blockNumber uint) | bytes32 | BLOCKHASH | hash of the given block - only works for 256 most recent blocks excluding current |
| block.gaslimit | uint | GASLIMIT | current block's gas limit |
| block.coinbase | address | COINBASE | current block's miner address |
| tx.gasprice | uint | GASPRICE | gas price of the transaction |
| tx.origin | address | ORIGIN | sender of the transaction (full call chain) |

Mathematical/Cryptographic Functions:

| Name | Type | EVM Opcode | Description |
|:-----------:|:----:|:----------:|:----|
| addmod(x, y, k uint) | uint | ADDMOD | compute (x + y) % k where the addition is performed with arbitrary precision and does not wrap around at 2**256 |
| mulmod(x, y, k uint) | uint | MULMOD | compute (x * y) % k where the multiplication is performed with arbitrary precision and does not wrap around at 2**256 |
| keccak256(...) | bytes32 |
| sha256 | | | |
| sha3 | | | alias to keccak256 |
| ripemd160 | | | |
| ecreover(v uint8, hash, r, s bytes32) | address | | |


Address Related:

Asteroid treats these as functions rather than properties, to avoid confusion with syntax like ```this.setX()```.

| Name | Type | EVM Opcode | Description |
|:-----------:|:----:|:----------:|:----|
| balance(address) | uint256 | BALANCE |
| transfer(address, amount uint256) | uint | MULMOD |
| send(address, amount uint256) | bool |
| call(address) | bool |
| delegatecall(address) | bool | DELEGATECALL  |

Contract Related:

| Name | Type | EVM Opcode | Description |
|:-----------:|:----:|:----------:|:----|
| this | address | ADDRESS | the current contract address
| selfdestruct(recipient address) | uint256 | SELFDESTRUCT | destroy the current contract, sending its funds to the given Address |


The general structure of a file is as follows:

### Asteroid EVM Functions

All functions must be able to be called by reference to a pa. This includes:

- ```external``` functions
- ```global``` functions
- ```internal``` functions
- function literals

```go
sig = first 4 bytes of CALLDATA
if sig == 0x0000000...0
    goto function 0
if sig == 0x0000000...1
    goto function 1
STOP // marks the end of the external functions
BOUNCEDEST // marks the start of the internal functions

STOP
// here are the actual functions
func add(a, b int) int { return a + b }
BOUNCEDEST
PUSH "hash of a"
MSTORE
PUSH "hash of b"
MSTORE
PUSH "hash of a"
MLOAD
PUSH "hash of b"
MLOAD
ADD
BOUNCE
// always include a stop so that there can be no bleed between functions
STOP

```

## Asteroid EVM Loops

Consider the following example:

```go
for i = 0; i < 10; i++ {

}
```

This simple loop is translated as follows:

```go
// init statement
1 | PUSH "hash of i"
2 | PUSH 0
3 | MSTORE

// condition
4 | BOUNCEDEST
5 | PUSH "hash of i"
6 | MLOAD
7 | PUSH 10
8 | LT

// if condition failed, jump to end of loop
9 | BOUNCEI 17

// regular loop processes would occur here

// post statement
10 | PUSH "hash of i"
11 | MLOAD
12 | PUSH 1
13 | ADD
14 | PUSH "hash of i"
15 | MSTORE

// jump back to them top of the loop
16 | BOUNCE 4
17 | BOUNCEDEST

// continue after the loop

```

## Asteroid EVM Conditionals

Consider the following example:

```go
if x = 0; x > 5 {

} else if x == 3 {

} else {

}
```

```go
// init
1 | PUSH "hash of i"
2 | PUSH 0
3 | MSTORE

// first condition
4 | PUSH "hash of i"
5 | MLOAD
6 | PUSH 5
7 | LT
// jump to next condition
8 | BOUNCEI 10

// 2nd if block
9 | BOUNCE 17

// evaluate second condition
10 | BOUNCEDEST
11 | PUSH "hash of i"
12 | PUSH 3
13 | EQ
14 | BOUNCEI 16

// 2nd if block
15 | BOUNCE 17

// else block
16 | BOUNCEDEST

// flow continues
17 | BOUNCEDEST
```

## Asteroid EVM Switch Statements

General structure:

```
evaluate original expression
for each case:
    evaluate each expression, Compare to result
    execute from there
    break = BOUNCE to end of most recent break-able construct
```

Consider the following example:

```go
switch x {
case 3:
    break
case 5, 6:
    break
}
```

```go
// evaluate original expression
1 | PUSH "hash of x"
2 | MLOAD

// first case
3 | PUSH 3
4 | EQ
// conditional jump to the next case
5 | BOUNCEI
// first case code
6 | BOUNCE // optional break statement

// second case
7 | PUSH 5
8 | EQ
// condition failed, jump to end
9 | BOUNCEI 12
// 2.2
10 | PUSH 6
11 | EQ
// conditional jump to t
```

This also works for switch expressions without targets:

```go
switch {
case x > 5:
    break
case x == 3:
    break
case x < 2:
    break
}
```

```go

```

## Asteroid EVM Assignments

General structure:

```go
for i in range len(left):
    evaluate left[i]
    evaluate right[i]
    contextually store it
```

Consider the following examples:

```go
x[6] = 7
```

## Asteroid EVM Return Statements

Return statements must push all the returned values onto the stack.

```
for each return parameter
    push it onto the stack
terminate function execution
```

```go
return 5, "hi"
```

```go
1 | PUSH 5
2 | PUSH "hi"
// top of the stack
```

## Asteroid EVM Expressions

### Asteroid EVM Binary Expressions

```go
// add left expr bytecode
// add right expr bytecode
// add operation
```

```go
1 | PUSH 1
2 | PUSH 4
3 | ADD
```

### Asteroid EVM Unary Expressions

```go
// add expr bytecode
// add operation
```

```go
1 | PUSH 0x000001
2 | NOT
```

### Asteroid EVM Call Expressions

### Asteroid EVM Index Expressions

Find the size of the type of an e

### Asteroid EVM Slice Expressions

### Asteroid EVM Identifiers

The data referenced by an identifier is either in machineStorage or in machineMemory. To access a variable, push the

```go
PUSH "hash of i"
```

And then either ```SLOAD```/```MLOAD``` the data at that address.
